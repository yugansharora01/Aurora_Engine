# Aurora

Aurora Only supports Windows till now
if you want to compile it then you will need visual studio 2019 and windows 10 sdk

Run the GenerateProjects.bat file , it will generate the project files and then you can compile it in the visual studio

If You want to compile it for vs2017 (which is not prefered as i've used c++17 which might give errors)
You can edit the .bat file to generate vs2017 projects by replacing "vs2019" by "vs2017" in the file
